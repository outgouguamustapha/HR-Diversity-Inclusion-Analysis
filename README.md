## Description

This project is part of the **PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual
Case Experience**, where I analyzed the *Pharma Group AG* HR dataset
with a focus on **Diversity & Inclusion**.

The goal was to design a **Power BI dashboard** that provides executives
and HR managers with actionable insights into gender balance, hiring
trends, promotions, turnover, and employee performance.

By developing custom KPIs and interactive dashboards, this project
highlights opportunities to improve **representation, retention, and
fairness** within the organization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Details

The analysis explored multiple dimensions of workforce diversity and
inclusion:\
- Employee distribution by **gender, age group, nationality, and
department**\
- **Hiring** patterns across departments, regions, and gender\
- **Promotion** analysis by level, gender, and department\
- **Turnover analysis**, including leavers by gender and performance
ratings\
- **Performance ratings** across departments, job levels, and retention
groups

This approach allowed for identifying areas where Pharma Group AG excels
and areas where targeted initiatives are needed.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Calculated KPIs

-   **Diversity Percentage (Female Workforce Representation)**\
-   **Employee Distribution by Gender**\
-   **New Hires (Male vs Female)**\
-   **Promotion Rates by Gender & Department**\
-   **Turnover %** = (Leavers √∑ Starting Headcount) √ó 100\
-   **Average Performance Ratings** by gender, job level, and leaver
    status

### What is Diversity Percentage?

The proportion of employees from a specific demographic group compared
to the total workforce.

> Diversity % (Females) = (Number of Female Employees √∑ Total Employees)
> √ó 100

### What does Turnover mean?

Turnover refers to the **rate at which employees leave the
organization**. High turnover can indicate low retention or
dissatisfaction, while low turnover reflects stability.

## Insights & Recommendations

### 1. Gender Balance in Leadership

**Insight**: Senior and executive management positions are dominated by men, while women are concentrated in junior roles.

**Recommendation**: Introduce mentorship programs, leadership development training, and sponsorship initiatives for women to prepare them for senior roles. Consider reviewing promotion criteria to ensure fairness and transparency.

### 2. Hiring Diversity

**Insight**: Hiring shows a close balance (51.5% women, 48.5% men) overall, but some departments (e.g., Operations, Sales & Marketing) still display male dominance.

**Recommendation**: Adopt department-specific hiring targets to achieve balanced representation. Leverage blind recruitment processes to reduce bias in early-stage candidate screening.

### 3. Promotion Disparities

**Insight**: Promotion rates favor men (64.7% of promoted employees were male). This highlights potential barriers for women advancing beyond mid-level positions.

**Recommendation**: Implement career path planning and performance evaluation workshops. Track promotion metrics annually by gender and department to ensure equity.

### 4. Turnover Analysis

**Insight**: Overall turnover rate is ~9.4%, with women showing a slightly higher turnover percentage (10.24%) than men (8.81%). Many leavers were from Operations and Sales & Marketing.

**Recommendation**: Conduct exit interviews to identify department-specific issues. Improve employee engagement by offering flexible work arrangements, recognition programs, and career growth opportunities. Address high turnover in Operations and Sales through workload management and employee support programs.

### 5. Performance Ratings

**Insight**: Performance ratings are nearly equal between genders (Women: 2.42, Men: 2.41), suggesting unbiased evaluation. However, overall ratings indicate a moderate performance level (2.4/4).

**Recommendation**: Introduce continuous performance feedback systems instead of annual reviews. Provide training, coaching, and recognition programs to improve average ratings.

### 6. Departmental Gaps

**Insight**: Operations and Sales & Marketing departments not only have the highest turnover, but also show lower female representation in higher-level roles.

**Recommendation**: HR should prioritize talent retention and inclusivity programs in these departments. Encourage internal mobility so employees can transition into roles better suited to their skills.

### 7. Strategic Inclusion Goals

**Insight**: While hiring balance is improving, promotion and leadership gaps prevent long-term equality.

**Recommendation**: Set measurable Diversity & Inclusion goals, such as ‚Äú40% women in management by FY25,‚Äù and track them using dashboards. Report progress transparently to leadership and employees.
