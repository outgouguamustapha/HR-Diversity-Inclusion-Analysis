## Description

This project is part of the **PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual
Case Experience**, where I analyzed the *Pharma Group AG* HR dataset
with a focus on **Diversity & Inclusion**.

The goal was to design a **Power BI dashboard** that provides executives
and HR managers with actionable insights into gender balance, hiring
trends, promotions, turnover, and employee performance.

By developing custom KPIs and interactive dashboards, this project
highlights opportunities to improve **representation, retention, and
fairness** within the organization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Details

The analysis explored multiple dimensions of workforce diversity and
inclusion:\
- Employee distribution by **gender, age group, nationality, and
department**\
- **Hiring** patterns across departments, regions, and gender\
- **Promotion** analysis by level, gender, and department\
- **Turnover analysis**, including leavers by gender and performance
ratings\
- **Performance ratings** across departments, job levels, and retention
groups

This approach allowed for identifying areas where Pharma Group AG excels
and areas where targeted initiatives are needed.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Calculated KPIs

-   **Diversity Percentage (Female Workforce Representation)**\
-   **Employee Distribution by Gender**\
-   **New Hires (Male vs Female)**\
-   **Promotion Rates by Gender & Department**\
-   **Turnover %** = (Leavers √∑ Starting Headcount) √ó 100\
-   **Average Performance Ratings** by gender, job level, and leaver
    status

### What is Diversity Percentage?

The proportion of employees from a specific demographic group compared
to the total workforce.

> Diversity % (Females) = (Number of Female Employees √∑ Total Employees)
> √ó 100

### What does Turnover mean?

Turnover refers to the **rate at which employees leave the
organization**. High turnover can indicate low retention or
dissatisfaction, while low turnover reflects stability.

## Insights & Recommendations

### 1. Gender Balance in Leadership

**Insight**: Women represent only 41% of the workforce, and their presence drops significantly at senior and executive levels.

**Recommendation**: Set measurable diversity targets (e.g., ‚Äúincrease women in leadership to 45% by FY25‚Äù) and implement leadership development programs to strengthen the pipeline for women in higher roles.

### 2. Hiring Diversity

**Insight**: Hiring in FY20 was nearly balanced (51.5% women vs. 48.5% men), showing progress toward inclusive recruitment. However, certain departments (e.g., Operations, Sales & Marketing) still skew male.

**Recommendation**: Continue balanced recruitment strategies, but introduce department-level hiring goals to correct localized gender imbalances.

### 3. Promotion Disparities

**Insight**: Of 51 promotions, only 35% went to women while men received 65%. This indicates a barrier for women advancing beyond mid-level positions.

**Recommendation**: Standardize promotion criteria, ensure transparent career progression, and adopt mentorship/sponsorship programs to help women move into management and senior roles.

### 4. Turnover Analysis

**Insight**: Overall turnover is 9.4%, with women‚Äôs turnover higher (10.24%) than men‚Äôs (8.81%).

**Recommendation**: Address retention challenges with flexible work options, recognition programs, and targeted engagement surveys. For high-turnover departments, investigate causes (workload, culture, management style) and design tailored retention strategies.

### 5. Performance Ratings

**Insight**: Performance scores are nearly equal by gender (2.42 vs. 2.41), suggesting unbiased evaluation. However, the overall average (2.41/4) indicates room for improvement in performance culture.

**Recommendation**: Replace annual reviews with continuous feedback systems. Offer training and coaching to raise performance standards while maintaining fairness.

### 6. Departmental Gaps

**Insight**: Operations and Sales & Marketing dominate in headcount but also experience higher turnover and lower female representation at senior levels.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize inclusivity programs, cross-functional training, and internal mobility opportunities within these departments to retain talent and diversify leadership pipelines.

### 7. Strategic Inclusion Goals

**Insight**: Hiring is approaching parity, but promotion disparities and leadership gaps remain critical challenges.

**Recommendation**: Develop a long-term Diversity & Inclusion roadmap with clear KPIs, including targets for leadership balance, promotion equity, and reduced gender turnover gaps. Report progress transparently in annual HR updates.
